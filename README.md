R Programming (Practical on RStudio)

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with R programming using RStudio. It covers the essential foundations of R for data analysis, statistical computing, and visualization.

ðŸ”¹ Key Learning Areas

Environment Setup: Setting working directories, following variable naming conventions, and organizing scripts.

Data Types & Structures: Practiced with numeric, character, and logical data types; explored vectors, lists, matrices, arrays, factors, and data frames.

Operators & Functions: Worked with arithmetic, relational, and logical operators; applied built-in functions for mathematical and statistical analysis.

Decision-Making Statements: Implemented conditional statements (if, if-else, switch) to control program flow.

Data Handling: Gained experience in reading and writing data from external files, including CSV and Excel (.xlsx) files.

Basic Visualization: Created plots, histograms, and bar charts for simple data exploration and analysis.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository serves as my practice ground for mastering the basics of R programming. It provides a solid foundation for future work in data science, bioinformatics, and statistical modeling.
